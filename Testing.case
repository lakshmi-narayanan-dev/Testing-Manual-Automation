Less Business Growth = More Customization
More Business Growth = Less Customization.
Apple, Tesla , Amazon, Meta , Google and Netflix. = Features differ with subscription not user specific.

Freelance Clients
Strong Online Presence > Leverage with networking > Freelance platform [fiverr upwork] > Offer/Free consulting/Trial Projects > Referrals from existing clients > Email marketing > Collaborate with other Freelancers > Expand skill set > showcase skills/testimony online > Repeat the loop.

Varieties vs Sales
More the varieties = Lesser the sales
Limited Varieties = More Sales [Apple]


Freelance Application Projects :
E-Commerce with customization
Aesthetical Website + Form Validation + Login
Booking Application + Payment Gateway

Customers To Reach [If you see any website or application having issue very worst please note here, so if you know the skill you can rebuild with issue resolved to acquire clients]
