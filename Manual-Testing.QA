QA Testing [Have a glance before your interview] - Process
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software ? - Collection of programs , related documents , assets , & logics combined to attain the client requirement sometimes integrated with hardware or servers.

Big Tech Companies make generic softwares like instagram, Facebook, Google target larger audience. 
Small Tech Companies make custom specific softwares like CRM, Websites, Apps to specific clients. [SaaS]

Software Engineering => It is a branch of CS that deals with design , development , Testing & maintaining code of an application.

Quality? Degree of Excellence of Something

Agile in the IT Industry? Fast Moving, Quick which is ameliorate version of waterfall model.

Environment or Test Bed ? UAT [user acceptance testing] , QE [Testing] , Prod [.com]

QA vs QC - Quality Assurance vs Quality Control => Prevention vs Curing

Prevention is an extensive testing process or Testing plan which comprises deploy time , deploy individual access, Changes made, Po tickets first, Regression must to each release, document the release tickets + open issues, Areas impacting on sprint refinement call.

Curing is one the issue has been deployed to production

Testing Types - White Box , Grey Box , Black Box  

Story points? Fibonacci numbers give story points to a ticket, because it forces the user to select a relative value. 
Fibanacci numbers
Estimation == Guessing story points
Tool used = Scrum Poker

Scrum - 15 mins daily update call = what done? What has to be done? What has been planned?

Bug Triage ? Checking old opened bugs to clean up the bucket if there is no major release or if the team has bandwidth.

Retrospective Call? Last sprint what went wrong or good? Who is the reason for that?

Story Refinement Call? PO explaining the ticket to both Dev + QA.
Dev => Code impact points
QA => Feature Impact points
Manager/Scrum Master => Timeline 

Bug Listing
P0 - Blocker
P1 - Critical
P2 - Important
P3 - Low priority / Aesthetics bugs are low priority

SLA? Service Level Agreement , Maximum Downtime accepted for a site in a year is 0.1% which is 8 hrs max.

Agile Weeks
1+2 = Planning, Understanding the flow
3-5 =  Code / Test cases 
6-7 = Blocker , Critical Issues 
8+9 = Regression / Release notes
10 = Release + Sanity + Inform Client & team.

CRUD - Create, Read, Update & Delete. = Dev & QA total life cycle.

Intermittent Bugs => Sometimes happening sometimes not [not consistent bugs]

Ad-hoc Release => Unplanned no document test case to test [client emergency time] 
Defect Cascading => Defect Happening due to a defect.

Unit = One module , Integration = Between Modules , System = E2E

NFT = Page loading, Performance, Malware, Exemption case behavior.

Regression => Check Previous release not affecting with current release

Buddy Testing => Dev + QA
Pair Testing => QA + QA
Monkey Testing => QA Alone

Agile Principles: [ATS MODX]
Accept last minute changes as per SLA
Deliver frequently not slow as a waterfall model.
Customer satisfy
Business QA Dev work together daily
Design changes from UX team
Self organized team - scrum master
Measure employee efforts
